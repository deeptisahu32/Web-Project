            <h2 class="title"> Story of Elephant </h2>
            <p Class="Paragraph">
                Here is a short, classic fable titled The Elephant
                <br><br>
                There were a fox and an elephant in a forest. 
                The two lived very intimately. so much so that one cannot leave the other. 
                Across the river was a sugarcane field. One day, the elephant wanted to eat sugarcane.
                The elephant said this to the fox: "Today I want to eat sugarcane," to which the fox replied, 
                "Yes, I also want to eat." "It has been a long day, and I have not eaten."
                <br><br>
                "But how do we cross the river?" "I can't swim," said the fox.
                The elephant said, "I will carry you on my back."
                <br><br>
                The elephant carried the fox on his back and crossed the river. 
                Together, they went to the sugarcane field. The fox ate quickly and got full, but the elephant's stomach did not get full. The full-bellied fox was mesmerized and howled loudly with joy.
                "Don't shout loudly; if anyone hears, they will come and beat both of them," said the elephant. But the fox did not listen to the elephant. Hearing the fox's shout, the owner of the farm came.
                <br><br>
                The fox ran fast and escaped the blows. But the elephant was heavy and big, so it could not escape the owner's blows. He hit the elephant hard. The elephant somehow escaped from him and came across the field.
                At last, the fox and the elephant met on the bank of the river. The elephant asked the fox, "Why did you do this?"
                <br><br>
                Then the fox replied, "I have a habit of howling when my stomach is full." The elephant did not say anything. Then the river had to be crossed from that bank to this bank. As before, the elephant came to the middle of the river, carrying the fox on its back. When the elephant reached the middle of the river, it plunged into the water and proceeded to bathe.                <br><br>
